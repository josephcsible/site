title: About
---
I'm a computer science student, mainly interested in statically-typed functional programming. Currently I'm coding in [Haskell](http://haskell.org), [Idris](http://idris-lang.org), [PureScript](http://purescript.org), and [Swift](https://swift.org).

This site is generated using [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a fantastic static site generator written in Haskell. The source code for the site is [here](https://github.com/oisdk/site).
