* Will Fancher - sorting traversables
* David Freuer - Indexed heaps
* Proof elision & totality - Idris, etc
* length-indexed foldr, foldl
* typeclass inlining as a way to unroll and inline (generic uncurry/curry, zipWith, etc.)
* Singletons and their messiness
* dependent if-then-else
* Manual difficult proofs
* explaining binomial heaps pearl, playing with priority queues article (square matrix)
* Manual proof on binomial heap
* Parity and "doubly-dependent" (types indexed by indexed types) - http://stackoverflow.com/a/13241158/4892417
* SMT solvers etc - Diatchki paper, there and back again paper (and video). Eventual normalizing solver
* Machine-integer-backed singletons (leftist heap)
* Generalizing Sort to Parts.
* Other uses for size-indexed heaps? Primes?
