  abstract = {We develop the theory and practical implementation of p-adic sparse coding of data. Rather than the standard, sparsifying criterion that uses the \$L\_0\$ pseudo-norm, we use the p-adic norm. We require that the hierarchy or tree be node-ranked, as is standard practice in agglomerative and other hierarchical clustering, but not necessarily with decision trees. In order to structure the data, all computational processing operations are direct reading of the data, or are bounded by a constant number of direct readings of the data, implying linear computational time. Through p-adic sparse data coding, efficient storage results, and for bounded p-adic norm stored data, search and retrieval are constant time operations. Examples show the effectiveness of this new approach to content-driven encoding and displaying of data.},

The p-adic coding algorithm may be considered as a generalization of a popular compression technique \textendash{} arithmetic coding algorithms. It is shown that for p = 2 the algorithm works as an integer variant of arithmetic coding; for a special class of models it gives exactly the same codes as Huffman's algorithm.

The new scheme uses a compact variable-length encoding that may be viewed as a generalization of radix complement notation. It allows exact arithmetic, and approximate arithmetic under programmer control. It is superior to existing coding methods because the arithmetic operations take particularly simple, consistent forms. These attributes make the new number representation attractive for use in computer hardware.},
