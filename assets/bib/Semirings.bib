	abstract = {This chapter presents basic foundations for the theory of weighted automata: semirings and formal power series. A fundamental question is how to extend the star operation (Kleene iteration) from languages to series. For this, we investigate ordered, complete and continuous semirings and the related concepts of star semirings and Conway semirings. We derive natural properties for the Kleene star of cycle-free series and also of matrices often used to analyze the behavior of weighted automata. Finally, we investigate cycle-free linear equations which provide a useful tool for proving identities for formal power series.},

Unfortunately, the benefits of this unified view are lost when the additional non-determinism structure of {\textbar}{MonadPlus}{\textbar} or {\textbar}Alternative{\textbar} is required.

This article recovers the essence of these two type classes by extending monoids to near-semirings with both additive and multiplicative structure. This unified algebraic view enables us to generically define the free construction as well as a novel double Cayley representation that optimises both left-nested sums and left-nested products.},

	abstract = {The problem is that roughly half of the instances we have for {MonadPlus} and Alternative today do not satisfy the oidification of the right-seminearring laws mentioned here.
There are really two or more families of {MonadPlus} instances. There are those satisfying "left catch" and those with "left distribution" -- some satisfy both.
Maybe, {IO}, and almost anything that doesn't use a list or other source of non-determinism fails these law and fails them badly.
Most monad transformers preserve the "sense" of what {MonadPlus} law they inherit from the base monad, but then things like {EitherT} e, or variations on {ListT} change the meaning of ({\textless}{\textbar}{\textgreater})
It gets worse when you move to Applicative vs. Alternative, because then things like Backwards[1] have a right unit instead of a left one, and the extra structure afforded by Applicative makes the type enforced left unit law we had in {MonadPlus} becomes an arbitrary imposition, even less likely to hold as we can see with Backwards. =(
So this is definitely the essence of something nice to have, it just isn't the essence of the {MonadPlus} or Alternative classes we have today.},
