	abstract = {This chapter presents basic foundations for the theory of weighted automata: semirings and formal power series. A fundamental question is how to extend the star operation (Kleene iteration) from languages to series. For this, we investigate ordered, complete and continuous semirings and the related concepts of star semirings and Conway semirings. We derive natural properties for the Kleene star of cycle-free series and also of matrices often used to analyze the behavior of weighted automata. Finally, we investigate cycle-free linear equations which provide a useful tool for proving identities for formal power series.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that monads are monoids in the category of endo-functors, and in fact so are applicative functors. Unfortunately, the benefits of this unified view are lost when the additional non-determinism structure of {\textbar}{MonadPlus}{\textbar} or {\textbar}Alternative{\textbar} is required.

This article recovers the essence of these two type classes by extending monoids to near-semirings with both additive and multiplicative structure. This unified algebraic view enables us to generically define the free construction as well as a novel double Cayley representation that optimises both left-nested sums and left-nested products.},

I show several novel uses, including improving parser accuracy by matching parsing algorithms to evaluation criteria; speeding up {DOP} parsing by 500 times; and 30 times faster {PCFG} thresholding at a given accuracy level. I also give an elegant, state-of-the-art grammar formalism, which can be used to compute inside-outside probabilities; and a parser description formalism, which makes it easy to derive inside-outside formulas and many others.},
