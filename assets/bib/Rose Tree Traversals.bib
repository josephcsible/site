  abstract = {Data.Tree includes unfoldTreeM\_BF and unfoldForestM\_BF functions to construct trees breadth-first using the results of monadic actions. The tree unfolder can be written easily using the forest unfolder, so I'll focus on the latter:

unfoldForestM\_BF :: Monad m ={$>$}
             (b -{$>$} m (a, [b])) -{$>$} [b] -{$>$} m [Tree a]
Starting with a list of seeds, it applies a function to each, generating actions that will produce the tree roots and the seeds for the next level of unfolding. The algorithm used is somewhat strict, so using unfoldForestM\_BF with the Identity monad is not exactly the same as using the pure unfoldForest. I've been trying to figure out if there's a way to make it lazy without sacrificing its O(n) time bound. If (as Edward Kmett suggested to me) this is impossible, I wonder if it would be possible to do it with a more constrained type, specifically requiring MonadFix rather than Monad. The concept there would be to (somehow) set up the pointers to the results of future computations while adding those computations to the to-do list, so if they are lazy in the effects of earlier computations they will be available immediately.},

  abstract = {A circular program creates a data structure whose computation depends upon itself or refers to itself. The technique is used to implement the classic data structures circular and doubly-linked lists, threaded trees and queues, in a functional programming language. These structures are normally thought to require updatable variables found in imperative languages. For example, a functional program to perform the breadth-first traversal of a tree is given. Some of the examples result in circular data structures when evaluated. Some examples are particularly space-efficient by avoiding the creation of intermediate temporary structures which would otherwise later become garbage. Lastly, the technique can be applied in an imperative language to give an elegant program.},
